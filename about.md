* I am a third year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia
  in Vancouver, Canada
* When I was in first and second year, I found [Cindy's blog](https://cindyxmiao.github.io)
  incredibly useful for me. It helped me see what was coming up ahead. Make sure to check
  her site out. 
* However, Cindy decided to transfer to computer science, taking her *proverbial* flashlight
  with her on a new adventure and leaving me in the dark - at least for the latter part of 
  second year and third year.
* I want to continue where she left off, and I hope my experiences may be useful for some of you
  prospective CPEN students out there, just like Cindy's blog.
