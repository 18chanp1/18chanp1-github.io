While no one ever reads the front matter of a book, it is 
still important for this section to exist. It sets the scene
for things to come on this site.

A TLDR can be found in the about page. 

### Origins of this site
I believe many of us engineers feel as though we are taking a step
through the unknown every time we start a new term. With a new term 
comes many courses, each with varying levels of instruction quality,
workload, and unique quirks. We are dropped in an unfamiliar situation
once a term, myself included.

What helped me a lot with managing expectations and calming my nerves,
was someone's first hand experiences, a guide through the forest. 
For a while, this was primarily *Reddit* and *ratemyprofessor.com*. 
However, these resources have a significant limitation in that users
typically reply in short form answers and do not go into much
detail about their experiences from the course. Moreover, they were
scattered all over the place and difficult to find. For example, if
you wanted to know about courses in the second year CPEN standard
timetable, you would have to find at least 3 reddit posts and sift
through all the comments to find a somewhat decent response. 

Soon after, I found an excellent resource which addresses 
the downfalls of browsing for course information on reddit, which was
[Cindy's blog](https://cindyxmiao.github.io/blog/) right here. The 
blog provides a linear, almost step-by-step tutorial through the 
engineering experiences, and gives incredibly insightful ideas for
future students that going through the same process. In a way this
blog was the guiding flashlight in the darkness for me, and I believe
for many students as well. I would highly encourage you to check the
blog out, and much of the content on my site will build on her content,
because why would I redo something only to make a worse version of it?

They say good things in life do not stay, and Cindy decides to take 
"a leap into the unknown" by transferring to CPSC, taking her 
*proverbial* flashlight with her and leaving me standing in the dark
once again. She explains her decisions and her process in detail in her
blog. I cannot say I disagree with her justifications, and I once
considered transferring to CPSC just like her, only to be hindered by
the bureaucracy of my decision making proccess (aka laziness). 

### Content Overview

That's a lot of plugging someone else's blog, but where do I come in?
Essentially, I want to continue Cindy's work in providing a guiding
hand for future CPEN students in their coursework and decisions they
will have to make, just like she did for me. This site will continue
where she left off, covering CPEN 2nd year courses (from term 2), CPEN
3rd year courses, and other bits and pieces that I feel are important
for my future comrades. Most of the content will likely be CPEN related,
given that I do not enjoy writing. I am purely doing this for the sake
of any future CPEN soul. Most of the content is pretty niche here, since
you could just google popular content anyways, which is obviously much
better in quality than I have to offer. 

### Disclaimers
Please do not hold me responsible for any inaccuracies or harmful effects
that happen as as result of you acting on my information. Purely reference only. You are also not allowed to comment on my poor writing
skills. After all, I chose engineering to avoid ever having to attend
another English class. I also cannot promise I can post often, since I
am not in CPSC, but CPEN. 

Thank you for entertaining my ramblings and chains of thought.
